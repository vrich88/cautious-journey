# Equinox

React Forum
Equinox is a full-stack MERN application that was designed and built collaboratively, then sent to deploy through Heroku. As the final project of our Web Development bootcamp, it is a symbol of the culmination of all skills taught and even more learned through trial and error. The task was to create a single-page application with a MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end which would implement user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform.
